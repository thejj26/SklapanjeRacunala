                    It does
                    all of the calculations and operations you throw at it. There are only two processor brands.
                    <b>Intel</b> and <b>AMD</b>. While both of them make good processors, Intel is better for
                    gaming, while
                    AMD is better for workstations. You should spend between 20% and 30% of your budget on your
                    processor.

                <p class="text flow-text">The graphics card, also known as the <b>GPU</b>, is probably the most
                    important
                    component if you are want a gaming or workstation based PC. There are two graphics card chip
                    makers:
                    <b>Nvidia</b> and <b>AMD</b>. There are also a lot of 3rd party brands that use those chips and
                    just
                    make the rest of the graphics card. Those are the ones you will most likely find, as the
                    so-called
                    <b>"founder's edition"</b> graphics cards(that are entirely 1st party) are very rare. You should
                    spend
                    around 40% of your budget on your graphics card. Some processors have intergrated graphics, and
                    don't
                    need dedicated graphics cards. Those processors have a <b>G</b> at the end of their name(AMD) or
                    don't
                    have <b>K</b>, <b>X</b> or <b>F</b> at the end of their name(Intel).</p>

                    is
                    plugged into it. They all differ mainly by their <b>chipset</b> and <b>socket</b>. Depending on
                    which
                    CPU you have, you will need a diffirent socket(<b>AM</b> for AMD and <b>LGA</b> for Intel). It
                    is
                    recommended that you spend less than your CPU on your motherboard. For most users, the

                <p class="title flow-text">Memory</p>
                <p class="text flow-text">Memory, also known as <b>RAM</b> is where all of your running apps are
                    stored.
                    Once you power off the computer, the memory get wiped clean. There are multiple aspects too look
                    for
                    when choosing memory.<br>
                    <b>Memory speed</b> measures how often your memory communicates with your CPU(measured in MHz).
                    AMD
                    CPUs benefit much more from higher memory speed. It is recommended to have a memory speed of
                    3000MHz or
                    higher for AMD CPUs.<br>
                    The <b>latency</b> or <b>CAS timing</b> is how much cycles it takes for your RAM to send data
                    requested
                    by the CPU. Generally, everything below <b>CL-20</b> is considered OK, and everything below
                    <b>CL-17</b>
                    is considered fast.<br>
                    The <b>number of memory sticks</b> affects your performance the most. It simply tells you how
                    many
                    sticks of RAM you are getting in the package. One is Ok for simple tasks, but having two or more
                    significantly increases performance, as long as you install them in <b>dual-channel mode</b>.
                    The
                    possible amount of ram sticks can be 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and even 32. Most computers use 1-4 RAM
                    sticks since
                    that is what most motherboards support.<br>
                    The <b>capacity</b> of your RAM simply tells you how much <b>GB</b> of RAM you are getting. 4GB
                    is
                    enough for very slight tasks, 8GB is enough for some gaming or every-day tasks, 16GB is OK for
                    most
                    games and workstation applications while 32GB+ is only used in expensive beastly computers that
                    can
                    handle everything you throw at them.

                    your
                    PC is off. There are 3
                    types of storage: <b>SSD</b>, <b>HDD</b> and <b>hybrid</b> drives. SSDs are the fastes of them
                    all
                    by a
                    lot. They don't have as much storage as the other parts and cost more. HDDs are the slowest but
                    they
                    have the most storage and cost the least. Hybrid drives or SSHDs are a hybrid of the two. They
                    are
                    faster than HDDs but slower than SSDs but have more storage than SSDs. Their cost is somewhere
                    inbewteen
                    the two. There are mulpitle for factor: <b>3.5"</b>(HDDs and SSHDs), <b>2.5"</b>(SSDs),

                    system.
                    <b>Modular</b> PSUs have all the cables seperate, so you can only plug in the ones you need.
                    <b>Non-modular</b> PSUs have all the cables attached. It is important not to cheap out on your
                    PSU
                    and
                    only buy from trusted brands. Those brands are: <b>Corsair</b>, <b>Coolermaster</b>,

                    <b>Seasonic</b> and <b>Fractal Design</b>. You should always get a PSU with more wattage than
                    you
                    need.
                    For example, if your system uses 400W you should get a 550W PSU. Better PSUs also have power
                    ratings.
                    These tell you how good their power efficiency is. They start with <b>80+</b> and go all the way
